# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A static website application that fetches data from a public Google Spreadsheet containing multiple city government projects and displays an interactive, zoomable, and scrollable timeline visualization for each selected project. The system enables users to select from a list of projects and view dedicated timelines showing news articles, social media posts, and other media coverage for each project over time without requiring backend infrastructure.

## Glossary

- **Timeline_System**: The complete web application that fetches and displays project news timeline data
- **Google_Spreadsheet**: A Google Sheets document containing a main project list sheet and individual project sheets
- **Main_Sheet**: The primary sheet containing the project directory with project_id, project_name, completed_date, and category fields
- **Project_Sheet**: Individual sheets named by project_id containing timeline events for that specific project
- **Timeline_Visualization**: The interactive chart component that displays chronological project news data
- **Media_Event**: An individual row from a Project_Sheet containing date_announced, news_link, headline, description, and party fields
- **Project_Selector**: User interface component allowing selection between different city projects
- **Project_Timeline**: Timeline visualization showing all media events for a selected project
- **Media_Type**: The type of media (news article, Twitter post, etc.) determined by the news_link URL format
- **Party_Attribution**: The political party field indicating which party is associated with the media event

3. WHEN a user selects a project, THE Timeline_System SHALL fetch the corresponding Project_Sheet data
4. THE Timeline_System SHALL display a Project_Timeline showing Media_Events for the selected project only
5. IF the Google_Spreadsheet is unavailable, THEN THE Timeline_System SHALL display an error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to interact with a zoomable and scrollable timeline, so that I can explore the data at different levels of detail and navigate through time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE Timeline_System SHALL integrate a timeline visualization library that provides native scroll functionality
3. THE Timeline_Visualization SHALL allow users to zoom in and out using standard interaction methods
4. THE Timeline_Visualization SHALL allow users to scroll horizontally through the timeline
5. THE Timeline_System SHALL ensure the visualization library handles zoom and scroll interactions smoothly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a citizen researching city projects, I want to see detailed information about each media event in timeline cards, so that I can access the full context including headlines, descriptions, source links, and associated political parties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. THE Timeline_System SHALL handle Media_Events with missing or incomplete information gracefully
5. THE Timeline_System SHALL visually distinguish different Media_Types within the timeline cards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content curator, I want to include different types of media (news articles, Twitter posts, etc.) as separate timeline entries, so that I can provide comprehensive coverage of project discussions across different media platforms and dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Timeline_System SHALL detect Media_Type based on the news_link URL format (Twitter, news sites, etc.)
2. THE Timeline_System SHALL display different Media_Types with appropriate visual styling in timeline cards
3. THE Timeline_System SHALL handle Twitter links as distinct Media_Events with Twitter-specific formatting
4. THE Timeline_System SHALL handle news article links as distinct Media_Events with news-specific formatting
5. THE Timeline_System SHALL allow multiple Media_Events for the same project on different dates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data curator, I want the system to correctly parse the multi-sheet Google Spreadsheet structure, so that project information and timeline events are properly organized and displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Timeline_System SHALL parse the Main_Sheet with columns: project_id, project_name, completed_date, category
2. THE Timeline_System SHALL parse individual Project_Sheets named by project_id with columns: date_announced, news_link, headline, description, party
3. THE Timeline_System SHALL use project_id to link Main_Sheet entries to their corresponding Project_Sheets
4. THE Timeline_System SHALL use the date_announced field to position Media_Events chronologically on each Project_Timeline
5. THE Timeline_System SHALL handle cases where a Project_Sheet referenced in the Main_Sheet does not exist

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the timeline to refresh with current data when I reload the page, so that I can see any newly added news coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads or refreshes, THE Timeline_System SHALL fetch the current data from the Google Sheet
2. THE Timeline_System SHALL display the most recent version of Project_Coverage available in the Google Sheet
3. THE Timeline_System SHALL handle new News_Events that were added since the last page load
4. THE Timeline_System SHALL maintain consistent data formatting regardless of when new content was added
